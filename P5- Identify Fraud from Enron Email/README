Files: 

poi_id.py: 
a shortened, cleaned version of the file to run. Can be ran as is and will output the final algorithm 

tester.py: 
tester file created by Udacity with slight modifications for updated StratifiedShuffleSplit. The original wouldn't work with my version of scikit
	changes specifically to:
	line 30: cv = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits = folds, random_state = 42)

	line 35: for train_idx, test_idx in cv.split(features, labels):

poi_id_long_output.py: 
a longer version of the poi_id file with multiple algorithms and outputs, mostly covered in the write up  

Enron_Project: 
the write up including the 6 questions to be covered and answers 

references.txt: 
a list of sites used for the project as references
