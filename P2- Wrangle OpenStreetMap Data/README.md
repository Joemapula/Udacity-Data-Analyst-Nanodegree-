# Project Description: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

Choose a region of the world from www.openstreetmap.org and then use data wrangling techniques to audit and clean the data. You'll then use a database to query the cleaned data.

## What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will be able to:

- Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.
- Parse and gather data from popular file formats such as .csv, .json, .xml, and .html
- Process data from multiple files or very large files that can be cleaned programmatically.
- Learn how to store, query, and aggregate data using MongoDB or SQL.

## Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this Project Rubric. https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/3168208620/rubric
